The VESC times out and shuts down its motors after 1000ms of no message.
Thus the minimum update rate is 1 Hz.

To calculate baud rate timings, use http://www.bittiming.can-wiki.info/ with settings
STMicro bxCAN
Clock rate 36 MHz
Sample point 87.5%
SJW 1

Put the parameters prescaler, bit length 1, and bit length 2 in CAN->Bit Timing Parameters
