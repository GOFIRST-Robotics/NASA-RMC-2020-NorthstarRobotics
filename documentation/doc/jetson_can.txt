How I fixed CANBUS (and the PS Eye)
By Jude Sauve, 2019-05-04

I installed the latest Jetpack, 4.2, L4T 32.1.0; 
PSeye just worked (unlike previous), lsmod worked (unlike previous)
We didn't need to compile ANYTHING!

Run once?
sudo modprobe can
sudo modprobe mttcan
sudo modprobe slcan
sudo modprobe can_raw
// I also commented out the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-mttcan.conf line, not useful?

Run each time?
sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 250000
sudo ip link set up can0
