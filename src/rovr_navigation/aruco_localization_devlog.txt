To make test.launch work with Aruco 2 (in seperate terminals):
$ roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_rgbd.launch camera:=realsense_d415
$ roslaunch launch/test.launch

Now working to update to Aruco 3 to improve distance sensing.
Source devel/setup.bash when things aren't recognized.

Pose working, low resolution


***** Jan. 25 *****
$ roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_rgbd.launch camera:=realsense_d415 color_width:=1920 color_height:=1080


***** Feb. 1 *****
Changing test.launch to custom.launch so it is more descriptive
Creating a custom realsense launch based on rs_rgbd.launch so the command line stuff can be built-in
