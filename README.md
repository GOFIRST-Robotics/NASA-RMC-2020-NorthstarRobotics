## About

> The goal of the competition is to collect icy regolith simulant from a simulated martian surface and deposit the collected material in a hopper. The top layer of the arena is a fine, dusty material, and the  bottom layer is gravel, which simulates icy regolith on mars. This is accomplished over two runs of 15 minutes. Massive bonus points are available for runs that are fully autonomous, but teleop control is available.

### What is ROS?
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Operating_System): 

> Robot Operating System (ROS or ros) is robotics middleware (i.e. collection of software frameworks for robot software development). Although ROS is not an operating system, it provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management. Running sets of ROS-based processes are represented in a graph architecture where processing takes place in nodes that may receive, post and multiplex sensor data, control, state, planning, actuator, and other messages.

With ROS, we can use existing packages, share our packages, and facilitate communication between the parts of our software

### Getting Started with ROS
-   ROS requires* Ubuntu OS (each version of ROS requires* a specific version of Ubuntu)
	-   Recommended:
	    -   Install Ubuntu 18.04  http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/
    
		-   Install ROS Melodic  http://wiki.ros.org/melodic
    -   Also acceptable:
	    -   If you already have installed a different version of Ubuntu, you may use its corresponding ROS version. The robotâ€™s computer is running 18.04 with Melodic, however, so you may have compatibility issues.
	    - Running a virtual machine  https://www.vmware.com/
	
	See documentation folder README for more information
