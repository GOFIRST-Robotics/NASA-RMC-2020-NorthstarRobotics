The NASA RMC 2020 repository for Northstar Robotics, a segment of University of Minnesota Robotics student group

## About

> The goal of the competition is to collect icy regolith simulant from a simulated martian surface and deposit the collected material in a hopper. The top layer of the arena is a fine, dusty material, and the  bottom layer is gravel, which simulates icy regolith on mars. This is accomplished over two runs of 15 minutes. Massive bonus points are available for runs that are fully autonomous, but teleop control is available.

### Getting Started with ROS
-   ROS requires* Ubuntu OS (each version of ROS requires* a specific version of Ubuntu)
	-   Recommended:
	    -   Install Ubuntu 18.04  http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/
    
		-   Install ROS Melodic  http://wiki.ros.org/melodic
    -   Also acceptable:
	    -   If you already have installed a different version of Ubuntu, you may use its corresponding ROS version. The robotâ€™s computer is running 18.04 with Melodic, however, so you may have compatibility issues.
	    - Running a virtual machine  https://www.vmware.com/
